  <div class='post'>
    I also want to use this blog as a place to write down the
    projects I want to try doing on top of talking about the ones
    I've already completed. So, here's a list of what's coming up
    and what I would like to come up:<br>
    <br>
    In the works:<br>

    <ul>
      <li>3D Whiteboard (almost done!)</li>

      <li>3D Volumetric Display (anyone want to donate an optical
      bench or some mirrors? :) (with help from Darryl)<br></li>

      <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusor">Fusor</a>
      (anyone know how to make a cheap vacuum chamber?) (together
      with Darryl)<br></li>

      <li>python Hobbyist Observer Tool (phot?, almost done... but
      not ready for the public yet)<br></li>

      <li>pyremote (python tool set for the mac remote... basically
      done, I'm just making some modules ftw)<br></li>
    </ul>To come:<br>

    <ul>
      <li><a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrofluid">Ferrofluid</a> (I'm
      doing this one for the kids at a local highschool)</li>

      <li>Hologram of Saturn (well, I have the camera, now I just
      need some clear nights!) (Helping Darryl)<br></li>

      <li>Micron sized tractor beam! (too cool to say no)</li>

      <li><a href=
      "http://www.nature.com/nature/videoarchive/x-rays/">Tape as
      an x-ray source</a> (again, vacuum chamber?)</li>
    </ul><br>
    Materials Wishlist:<br>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.unitednuclear.com/vacpump.htm">Vacuum
      Pump</a></li>

      <li>Vacuum Chamber! (or at least the materials to make
      one)<br></li>

      <li>NeHe Laser</li>

      <li>Heavy Water (harder to get in Canada than I thought...
      united nuclear has some if someone wouldn't mind bringing me
      some back from the US)</li>

      <li>Microscope</li>

      <li>Oscilloscope</li>

      <li>Wave Generator</li>

      <li>LCD Projector (3d (whiteboard|display))<br></li>

      <li>That paper thing... what's it called?... money?</li>
    </ul>On top of those personal projects, I'm also working with
    <a href="http://astro.utoronto.ca/%7Ematzner/">Chris
    Matzner</a> on protostellar outflow-driven turbulence. To put
    shortly, we are basically seeing if jet's shot out by young
    stars, protostars, can cause a feedback effect and, by the
    creation of super-sonic turbulence, slow down star formation
    rates. I'll put a post about that sooner rather than later... I
    think I will start a one post per day rule to get this thing
    going.
