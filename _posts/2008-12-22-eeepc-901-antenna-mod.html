    Well, after the treachery of exams and then the confusing
    transition into vacation I finally think it's time to update!
    Well, I've done quite a lot: everything seems ready for the
    final version of the 3D whiteboard along with the construction
    of the 3D display. Furthermore everything is in motion to begin
    the fusion device first semester of the next academic year
    (damn you Darryl for leaving to Singapore!). But, in the realm
    of the actual rather than the theoretical, I have modded my
    eeePC 901 to support external antennas (for only $20).<br>
    <br>

    I love my eeePC, it has changed the way I work. I carry it
    around with me everywhere scarcely ever noticing its weight
    allowing me to do work almost anywhere! It's powerful enough
    for testing, enough hard drive space for my tools, runs of my
    simulation and even some music. The only downside when I first
    got it: the antennas weren't powerful enough to pick up those
    elusive wifi signals. Although, after cracking the magic device
    open I found that the internal antennas were hooked up using
    U.FL connection. And so the hacking began!<br>
    <br>
    [picture of wireless module to come in very near future]<br>
    <br>
    Above you can see the actual wifi module from the expansion bay
    (this is the removable region in the center of the bottom of
    the laptop). This led me to buy a U.FL to RP-SMA cabel from
    hyperlinktech (<a href=

    I chose RP-SMA for the outside connection because I already had
    an RP SMA antenna from an old router and it seems to be the
    most popular kind (so getting new antennas shouldn't be too
    much of a problem). I also bought a 9dB 2.4GHz antenna from the
    same store. 2.4GHz is the frequency of wireless internet
    (802.11a/b/n). In order to make everything fit into the eee, I
    had to sand the stopper almost all the way down until it looks
    like:<br>
    <br>
    <a href= "/images/eeepc/large-IMG_2630.JPG">
        <img style= "margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;"

    </a>
    <br>
    <br>
    In order to make this hack a nice clean one, I decided to
    completely gut out the computer so I could put everything back
    where I wanted to. There are MANY screws so make sure to keep
    everything organized. I normally take a sheet of paper and put
    the screws on different parts of it while marking in marker
    where those screws should be (and how many of them I took
    out!). I also took out the screen because I was going to
    machine the hole, but I later realized it was easy enough to do
    at home. Here's a beauty shot of everything dismantled:<br>
    <br>
    <a href= "/images/eeepc/large-IMG_2634.JPG">
        <img style= "margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;"

    </a>
    <br>
    <br>
    I decided to have the RP SMA connection come out of the "lock"
    region of the case (right behind the eth0 port). So, I had to
    make sure that the wire didn't block or bend the motherboard
    (scary thought! one crack and you have transformed your eeepc
    into a nice paper weight!). So, I drilled the hole for the
    connection making sure that it's center was .5mm below the
    stand of the motherboard (circled in red). To make the hole i
    used a standard dremel tool outfitted with a 1/8" drill
    bit.<br>

    <a href= "/images/eeepc/large-IMG_2631.JPG">
        <img style= "margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;"

    <br>
    With that completed I snaked the wire underneath where the
    motherboard sits. I now plugged the cable to the wifi module,
    unplugging one of the internal antennas (I recommend doing this
    before remounting everything as it takes a good amount of
    force. I even detached the wifi module to make sure there'd be
    no damage to the motherboard). Once everything is hooked up, it
    should look like this:<br>

    <a href= "/images/eeepc/large-IMG_2646.JPG">
        <img style= "margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;"

    This has been a tremendous gain! The 3dB antenna fits nicely in
    the carrying case (and so does the eee even with the added
    width) and the 9dB fits nicely in my backpack. Below is a
    comparison between only internal antennas, external mod without
    any antenna and finally external mod with 3dB antenna using
    `iwlist wifi0 scanning`<br>

    30% gain with a cheap antenna I just had lying around. I'll
    post some stats on the 9dB antenna once I am in a controllable
    enough area (ie: home). Remember, <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel">dBm</a> work on the log
    base 10 scale, so every unit change in dB is a factor of 10
    change in strength.<br>
    <br>
    So tell me how this mod works for you or if there are any
    points that I didn't clearly explain! Happy Hacking!
