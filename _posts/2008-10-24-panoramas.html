    So, a little bit ago I got a new camera (well, I guess it's no
    longer new) so I thought, since I couldn't afford any great
    lenses, I'd get acquainted with good post-processing. First
    thing to attend to was mending a mosaic of pictures together
    into one seamless picture. So, bellow is my evolution in trying
    to get a good panorama:<br>
    <br>
    Balcony View:<br>
    This one didn't look too bad. I was lucky that lighting
    conditions didn't change too much as I took all the photos.<br>

    <br>
    Night Panorama:<br>
    I was rushed. As a result I didn't get enough pictures to get
    good perspective. Also, you can see the lighting conditions
    changed drastically as I took the pictures.<br>

    <br>
    Dawn Panorama:<br>
    That's not change, that's more of the same! I took these
    pictures fast enough to have some resemblance to homogeneous
    lighting, even though it's homogeneously dark.<br>

    <br>
    Toronto Through a fishbowl:<br>
    This one turned out great! I took more than enough pictures and
    did it quickly. You can see a few artifacts from mending (check
    the train tracks), but all in all it turned out great. In fact,
    there are parts of the image that were cut out of all the
    photos that I had to reconstruct completely using photoshop
    (special prize to whoever can guess where). If you want to see
    a full resolution (17mb, 5989x4058) version, go <a href=

    <br>
    Sunset:<br>
    So, I was doing work and I look out the window and I see a
    rainbow AND the moon. So, I quickly try to get as many pictures
    as I can for a panorama. Didn't turn out exactly how I wanted,
    but it is still quite cool!<br>

    border="0"></a><br>
    <br>
    For all these images, I loaded them into photoshop and used the
    automated function "photomerge". Once the images were merged I
    blended the edges and applied any sort of photoshop magic I
    could to make the image seem smooth. This was hard in some
    cases (ie: in the last image, sunrise, you can see a drastic
    color change in the sky).<br>
    <br>
    These skills are actually quite useful for many things,
    especially the telescope camera. I used basically the same
    technique to make the moon picture from the <a href=
    "http://fluxtrap.blogspot.com/2008/10/telescope-camera-howto-v1.html">
    telescope camera</a> (although I probably should have used a
    more stack oriented program... that's what the future is
    for!).<br>
