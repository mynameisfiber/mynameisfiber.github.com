As you know, I recently moved to a new place (and built myself a
[desk!](/projects/building/2011/09/10/desk-building/)), but now it's time to
have a bed!  One thing I considered when designing this bed was how little
space I had and how every inch is precious.  As a result, this bed as an
extraordinary amount of storage underneath and, although it is built like a
tank, it disassembles very easily for when I move (edit: I have since moved and
the bed came apart easily, disassembled into compact pieces and was reassembled
in <1h).

Unfortunatly, I didn't take pictures for most of the process, but here's what I
did take... enjoy!
