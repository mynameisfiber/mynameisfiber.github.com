A friend of mine, Julia Kodysh, was on her way to [burning
man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Man) and needed a good costume to
wear.  Luckily, we came up with an idea for an awesome glowing t-shirt on a
recent camping adventure... so we got to building it!  The catch: we had 24
hours to complete the project.

Originally, the LED heart was going to pulse with her heart beat.  However,
after fiddling with an infrared led heart monitor we rigged up and not being
able to get the signal to be stable, we just went with randomizing when pulses
happen.  Enjoy the build!
