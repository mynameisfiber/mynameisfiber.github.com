  <div class='post'>
    Well, I thought it was about time to post something, so let me
    show you this little project I've been tinkering with. It
    basically allows me to control my server with a cellphone. This
    can be applied to any computer with python installed and can do
    really anything (right now I have it search/download bittorrent
    files).<br>
    <br>
    It basically works by creating a master thread on the server
    that constantly checks some secured twitter account for
    directed messages. This basically means that you can send a
    directed message to some secured user through twitter from your
    cell phone and when the computer reads this message it will act
    on it.<br>
    <br>
    The following is the main code: it creates a main thread on the
    computer listening for new messages. When a new message is
    found, a new thread is created and the correct command is
    executed (the commands are defined in the configuration file
    which will come soon). The benefit to creating new threads is
    that the task can be halted later by initiating a stop command
    (the stop commands are hard programmed and are automatically
    generated for each configuration defined command).<br>

[Connection]
username = Secured Username
password = Password of secured username
recieveID = User ID of the command issuer

[reverseSSH]
match = reverse (?P<IP>(?:\d{1,3}\.?){4}) (?P<PORT>\d+)
command = ssh -R %(PORT)s:localhost:22 %(IP)s
output = start

[Talk]
match = say (?P<text>.+)
command = flite -t "%(text)s"
output = None

[Bittorrent]
match = bt (?P<search>.+)
command = transmission-remote -a "`/home/fiber/projects/pyisohunt/pyisohunt.py -n 1 -s seeds -p '%%(url)s' %(search)s`"
output = output
{% endhighlight %}

<br>
    <br>
    The commands use regex in order to extract keywords. So
    basically, I can SMS 'd user say hello there' and my computer
    will initiate the command `flite -t "hello there"` once it
    receives it! I also have the output of each command regulated
    by the 'output' parameter on each command. It can either notify
    me when the command starts, when it ends, or it can send me the
    output of the command (or, of course, none of the above).<br>
    <br>
    Now, the interesting part is the bittorrent section. Here I
    send the keywords to another little program I made (really just
    a bunch of regex and rss tricks... I'll include it at the end).
    This program returns the URL of the highest seeded match to the
    keywords from IsoHunt.com. This is sent to transmission and my
    server starts downloading the torrent! (I use <a href=
    "http://www.transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> for
    bittorrent on my server with the Clutch web UI) So essentially,
    if a friend recommends a movie (that is in the public domain,
    of course ;) when I am out, I can tell my server to start
    downloading it so it will be ready when I am home.<br>
    <br>
    Also, I can set my server to start a reverse-ssh connection to
    any IP. This is great because I can keep my router locked down
    but still connect to my server from the outside. Note: normally
    this sets my server to set up a reverse connection to an
    intermediary server so that everyone can be behind a firewall,
    but I'd like to keep the location of this server unknown for
    now.<br>
    <br>
    Finally, the following is the source for pyisohunt.py. It was a
    true hack so don't expect clean code!<br>
