        So, I was at active surplus (with trusted, albeit slightly
        slow, sidekick Darryl) looking for parts for the fusor or
        the 3D display when I ran into this amazing old school
        oscilloscope. After quickly brainstorming some reason I
        could justify buying this beautiful piece of science
        equipment (or history depending on your view) I got it! The
        justification is actually quite good: instead of buying a
        Geiger counter, we can use activated aluminum and a charged
        plate (neutron hits the aluminum, shoots of an electron
        which gets captured by the plate which turns into a signal
        that the oscilloscope can see) to verify fusion is
        happening.<br>
        <br>
        Anyways, here's a little video of the piece in action:
        hooked up to my speakers playing Roads by Portishead. Sorry
        about the video quality... also the cameras refresh rate
        doesn't do justice to the display.<br>

        As for the fusor route, we are going to get florescent
        transformers (~20,000V at a couple miliamps) for power, and
        hopefully e-bay will have the correct vacuum pump (it's
        hard to find ones that go down to 5microns). As for the
        vacuum container... we might just have to get one custom
        made. This is one piece that I don't really want to try
        building myself since it's the only part of the project
        that could seriously maim us.<br>
        <br>
        Oh, and stay tuned... tomorrow I'm going to post a video I
        did a while ago about getting a cool explosion using
        ferrocium which you can get out of a common lighter!<br>
