While taking a summer school at [UC-HiPACC](hipacc.ucsc.edu/) on
[astro-computing](http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/ISSAC2012.html) (sounds fancy!) we
were given a tour of the [NERSC](http://www.nersc.gov/) supercomputers!  It was
a lot of fun and very very noisy (watch the video!).  Anyways, it was really
nice being able to see first hand the nameless computers that I've been using.
Enjoy!
