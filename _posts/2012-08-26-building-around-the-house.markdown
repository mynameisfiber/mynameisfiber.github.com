So, I moved again which means time to build new stuff!  For this apartment, we decided to build:

* pan holder (made from 1/2" steel pipe's) capable of holding the ridiculous
  amount of pans we have (the pictures only show half of our pans!)
* bathroom shelving system (made with rope and spare wood... it hangs from the
  ceiling so we didn't have to drill into the tile)
* a large kitchen table.  The table's frame was made from 1/2" steel pipe with
  flanges to hold a very thick top.  Currently, the top is awaiting a good
  planing and everything should be ready!  It's massive at 6'x4' with plenty of
  storage.
