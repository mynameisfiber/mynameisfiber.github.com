  <div class='post'>
    So, after a long time working solely in <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">FORTRAN</a>, I decided
    to try to find a way to use python to get the same things done.
    I wanted to incorporate what I had done in FORTRAN as a library
    that way I wouldn't have to recode much and could instead
    continue developing (except now in the wonderful warmth of
    python)<br>
    <br>
    The most successful method I tried was using f2py. What f2py
    does is take in a FORTRAN module (see the tvd module below, for
    example) and makes a python interface for it. What this means
    is that you can import fortran code and run it at the the
    speeds you would expect from compiled code!<br>
    <br>
    Let me first take you through <a href=
    "http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=3366502883257825993&amp;postID=3040328901315897452#code">
    the module</a>. You can see from the 'include "omp_lib.h"' that
    I'm using <a href=
    "http://openmp.org/wp/openmp-specifications/">openMP</a>. For
    those that don't know, openMP is a great way of making any code
    parallel on shared memory machines (ie: if you have a computer
    with multiple cores or hyper-threading). The lines with
    "!$OMP", called <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_(programming)">pragmas</a>,
    are in fact calls to openMP and effect to proceeding code. In
    addition, I created a function called "set_num_threads" to
    manually change the ammount of parallelization that is used by
    the program (by default, the number of threads is equal to the
    number of CPU's on the machine). A great thing about this
    "!$OMP" convention is that, since ! designates a comment, you
    can still compile and run this code without having openMP
    enabled!<br>
    <br>
    Now, let's move on to <a href=
    "http://www.scipy.org/F2py">f2py</a>! You can see every
    subroutine (and function) has lines starting with "!f2py".
    Similar to openMP, this is used to designate various options.
    For example, the "!f2py threadsafe" tells python that the
    function will be using various threads and that the gil
    shouldn't be used. As a result, we cannot take in or return in
    python objects (there are methods to take in <a href=
    "http://cens.ioc.ee/projects/f2py2e/usersguide/index.html#call-back-arguments">
    python callbacks</a> when not using threadsafe). The intent
    option sets if a parameter is going to be inputed or outputted.
    With intent, python knows how to interpret python input and
    what should be given back as return values.<br>
    <br>
    So, let's look at the function set. It takes in, in python, u
    and CFL. The other parameters are optional. In addition, you
    can see that "dt" and "maxv" are inputs but are calculated in
    the function. I did this little hack so that I can return
    multiple values to python. So in the end, this function is
    defined, in the python space, as "u, dt, maxv = step(u, cfl)".
    The most beautiful part is that when passing u to this module
    from python, u is a numpy array! Note that the other functions
    that are called (namely, do[XYZ] are also defined in the
    module, however for the sake of brevity they are not listed
    below).<br>
    <br>
    In order to use this fortran module, we need to compile it with
    f2py. The end result is a .so that can be imported into
    fortran. I compiled this particular module with `f2py -c -m tvd
    --f90flags="-fopenmp -lm " --opt="-O3 --ffast-math" -lgomp
    --fcompiler=gnu95 tvd.f90` So, let's go through this. "-c"
    tells f2py to look at the pragmas in the code in order to learn
    how each function should be handled. "-m tvd" defined the name
    of the resulting module. the --f90flags, as expected, dictate
    the flags send to the FORTRAN compiler. I have chosen to use
    openmp (not needed, by the way, with newer versions of GCC
    where openMP is built-in) and libmath. opt sets the
    optimization flags. -lgomp tells f2py to use openMP (this
    redundancy seems necessary although I have a feeling that one
    of my statements telling f2py to use openMP is redundant).
    Finally, "fcompiler" tells f2py to use gfortran.<br>
    <br>
    Let's look at a little session with this module, as to
    understand what f2py created. (I use <a href=
    "http://ipython.scipy.org/">ipython</a> for its
    tab-completion)<br>
    <br>
    {% highlight python linenos %}
In [1]: import numpy

In [2]: from tvd import tvd

In [3]: u = numpy.random.random((4,100,100,100)) #create a random velocity field

In [4]: u[0,:,:,:] = 1 #set density to 1 to avoid instabilities

In [5]: %timeit output = tvd.step(u, 0.65)
10 loops, best of 3: 704 ms per loop
    {% endhighlight %}

    <br>
    Amazing! It takes <b>704ms</b> to evolve a 100x100x100
    isothermal grid! Normal usage of this would be: `u, dt, maxv =
    tvd.step(u, 0.65)`. One note, I write "from tvd import tvd"
    because the first "tvd" represents the file and the second
    "tvd" represents the FORTRAN module. If instead I had just
    written tvd.f90 as a series of subroutines and not as a FORTRAN
    module, I could have simply written "import tvd". Now, I can
    get to doing real science instead of being swamped by the
    inhuman syntax of FORTRAN (a language best spelled in all caps
    to truly illustrate its crimes).<br>
    <br>
    And now, for the code... I'm leaving out the actual
    computational part however I may release that in the near
    future (comment if you'd like to see it!).<br>
