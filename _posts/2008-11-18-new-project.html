    Well, it's taking longer than I expected for the parts for my
    most recent project to come in. I'm waiting for some wireless
    pigtails (U.FL to RP-SMA) so that my EEE PC has an external
    antenna (an easy hack, but one I haven't seen any documentation
    online for).<br>
    <br>
    In the meantime, here's an old video I made a while ago playing
    with non-Newtonian fluids. This is really easy to make (just
    saturate water with corn starch) and very fun! Non-Newtonian
    fluids are fluids whose viscosity is dependant on the applied
    strain. So, the strain from the speaker constantly hitting the
    fluid causes it to become much more viscous to the point of
    appearing solid. This causes all sorts of fun! In this video I
    played a 100hz sin wave through the speaker. I did this later
    as a demonstration at the Dragon Academy and I have to say it
    was a great success, I recommend it for any teachers or
    demonstrators. Hope everyone enjoys!<br>
