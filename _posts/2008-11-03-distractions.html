    Well, exams are finally done but I am still contending with all
    the work I had to put off. In the works is a post on the topic
    of conscience and the release of my mac remote code. For now, I
    will distract everyone with an old youtube video of mine:
    exploding flint (well, actually ferrocium)<br>
    <br>
    <object height="344" width="425">
      <param name="movie" value=
      "http://www.youtube.com/v/wLp-3YBZQkE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0">
      <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true">
      <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always">
      <embed src=
      "http://www.youtube.com/v/wLp-3YBZQkE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"
      type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess=
      "always" allowfullscreen="true" height="344" width="425">
    </object><br>
    <br>
    The video pretty much explains itself. It is a nice little demo
    on the properties of ferrocium. In the end, this stability (or
    lack thereof) is why it proves to be so useful in lighters.
    Enjoy!
