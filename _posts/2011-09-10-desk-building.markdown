I recently moved into a new apartment which means I need a desk!  Below is the
construction of my "made to fit in my tiny NY room" desk, which spanned over a
couple of days.  The resulting structure was perfect for my uses, although it
was a bit wobbly.  That being said, I learned quite a lot during the building
process... namely to double check my plans before building!
