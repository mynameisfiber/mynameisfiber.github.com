    Alright, well... after many failed attempts to start a blog I
    will, instead of starting and ending with an introductory post,
    get right into it. This will be kind of odd as I've already
    completed this project in full, but soon i'm going to be doing
    it again, so stay tuned for version two of this howto!<br>
    <br>
    Anyways, I've always wanted a camera for my telescope but they
    were always too damn expensive! So, I did what any hacker would
    do: made my own. The good thing about something like this is
    that it can be used for any kind of optical system... in fact I
    will be making one for a microscope soon (and be using properly
    milled pieces).<br>
    <br>
    So, for this project you'll need:

    <ol>
      <li>A webcam (any kind will do, I got a cheap $8 logitec
      express from canada computers)</li>

      <li>Some sort of metal case. It should have at least an
      internal volume of 2.5x5x3.5cm (might be different depending
      on what webcam you get)</li>

      <li>Computer fan with heat sink (see image)</li>

      <li>Camera film tube.</li>
    </ol>(Total cost: ~$20)<br>

    And now to begin the fun! Find out how to open the webcam and
    do so. For my webcam there was a screw covered by a small
    plastic cap that held the whole unit together. You can always
    just smash it apart, but you don't want to destroy the delicate
    CCD or the circuitry!<br>

    Once open, disconnect the mic (you might want to keep it for
    later, it became really useful in my assembly) and take the
    circuitry out of the casing. Make sure the pins on the board
    for the mic are stowed away, some cameras are already quite
    compact (in the image below I had to fold the pins down, making
    sure not to touch anything else). Now take the lens off of the
    CCD (it unscrews). Be careful because you don't want the CCD to
    get dirty! You'll see that there is still a plastic piece where
    the lens used to be that is screwed onto the board (I'll call
    this the lens holder). Screw this off and break the glass off
    of it! This glass is an infrared filter and we don't want it.
    Make sure that everything is clean and screw this piece back
    on. Now you have a visible+infrared camera, but we want
    more!<br>

    Also, a good tip is to take the lens and glue something long to
    it... then you can use this as a lens cap so the CCD doesn't
    get dirty when you store it. Save this step for last so you can
    see what would best serve your needs.<br>

    Now, look at the main cable that connects the USB to the
    circuit board... you need to identify the ground and power.
    Voltmeters are useful for this (just plug in the USB cable and
    check where the voltage flows). Remember where this is for
    future reference.<br>
    <br>
    Let's take care of the casing for now. First, decide what you
    are going to use as the front and back of the case. Screw the
    fan/heat sink securely to the back of the case. You want to
    make sure that it is secure so that you don't have any excess
    vibrations. Next, drill a hole in the front the size of the
    circle of the lens holder from before. This is where the CCD is
    going! Also, figure out how you want the wires to come out of
    the case... I drilled a hole in the side and had all the wires
    (USB+power to the fan) coming out of it. And finally, take that
    film canister and cut the base off so it becomes just a tube.
    Glue the lip side down onto the case so that it is centered on
    the hole for the CCD. I recommend using epoxy or something that
    gives a bit... more rigid glues (super glue and the like) seem
    to chip off after extensive use with things like this. And now
    the case is ready... almost done!<br>

    Now you want to get all the wires through the hole in the case
    you prepared. Solder the wires for the fan onto the correct
    parts of the USB wire (I found it useful to branch off the
    wires coming off the CCD board using the wires from the
    microphone so I had more room to do my work). Before
    reattaching the USB wires to the CCD board, apply some glue to
    the outside of the lens holder (being extra careful not to get
    any on the ccd... this is how i ruined my first CCD) and get it
    securely fitted into the hole in the case. Now, the final step:
    attach the usb cable and close the case up!<br>

    You are finally ready to take pictures! Use whatever webcam
    program you prefer. I personally use a script I made in python
    that uses openCV to control the webcam and find the FWHM (full
    width half maximum) of a selected region so you know everything
    is in focus. In a later post I will release this code! For now
    I'll leave you with a picture of the moon I took while testing
    this unit. I used gqcam to take the pictures and photoshop to
    put them together. They were taken off my 4.5" Astroscan
    telescope (not the best... in fact most distortion comes from
    the antique optics in the giant red beast, but when it clears
    up I'll take/post some pictures with my 8" Celestron!).<br>
    <br>
    Hope everyone enjoyed this and please post pictures you take
    with the camera here! Oh, and if you have any question, just
    post a comment.<br>
